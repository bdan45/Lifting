            <h2>Lifting</h2>
            <p>The first step to gaining muscle mass is having a solid workout routine. I have found lifting weights to be the optimal way. 
                As a beginner, I would reccomend starting off with a full body routine, three times a week. We will break these day into Day A, B, and C.
                Your week will look like this: AxBxCxx with "x" being a rest day. Each day will have a push, pull, and a leg exercise to ensure all muscle groups are hit.
                Heres a sample you can follow:
            </p>
            <div class="day">
                <h4>Day A</h4>
                <p>Squats 3x8</p>
                <p>Bench 3x8</p>
                <p>Barbell Rows 3x8</p>
            </div>
            <div class="day">
                <h4>Day B</h4>
                <p>Deadlifts 3x5</p>
                <p>Overhead Press 3x8</p>
                <p>lat Pulldown 3x8</p>
            </div>
            <div class="day">
                <h4>Day C</h4>
                <p>Barbell Lunges 3x5(each side)</p>
                <p>Dumbbell Bench 3x8</p>
                <p>Dumbbell Rows 3x8</p>
            </div>

        <section id="diet">
            <h2>Diet</h2>
            <p>Your diet is just as important as your workout. It is impossible to outlift a bad diet. The first thing to talk about is micronutrients. 
                These are protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Proteins are what helps build your muscle, carbohydrates and fats both give your body fuel. 
                As a general rule while trying to build muscle, you should aim for almost 2g of protein per kg of body weight. 
                The rest of your calories should come from an even split of carbs and fats.
            </p>
            <p>Calories are the next thing to consider. It is essential to understand what your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) are.
                BMR is the amount of calories your body burns just for maintenance. As in, if you laid in bed all day doing nothing, this is the amount of calories your body consumes. 
                TDEE takes into account all of the activity you are doing. If you are moderately active, its usually close to 1.3 times your BMR. 
                There are calculators online that give you a rough estimate of this number based off of age, sex, height, and weight. 
                When it comes to gaining weight, you should your TDEE + 500 calories. This will help you gain 1lb each week which is important for muscle growth.

        <section id="rest">
            <h2>Rest</h2>
            <p>The final part of the equation is rest. Your body needs time to recharge and rebuild the muscle fibers that you broke down while lifting. 
                It is crucial to get 8 hours of sleep consistently. If not, your body will be overworked and you will be fatigued. 
                On rest days, I like to stretch my body to keep it flexible.
